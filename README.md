# UTravel
Angular project showcasing UI/UX design, API integration, and modern frontend development.

UTravel is a personal project built to showcase my skills in Angular development, UX/UI design, and the creation of modern web applications.
The goal of this project is to demonstrate clean architecture, component-driven development, API integration, animations, and a smooth user experience across different sections of the app.

It includes:

Dynamic data visualization using external APIs (REST Countries & Unsplash).

Reusable and fully standalone Angular components.

Responsive layouts and custom UI elements.

Interactive features such as image carousels, cards, maps, and filtered tables.

Modern styling using SCSS, animations, and design best practices.

This repository reflects my technical background, attention to detail, and passion for building high-quality front-end experiences.
